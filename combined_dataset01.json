        "question": "Can you explain this slide?",
        "answer": "This slide introduces Chapter 1, focusing on \"Statistical models and social science.\" It introduces the connection between statistical models and social science. It highlights the complexity of social data, the need for aggregate predictability, and the application of AI/ML in various domains like online moderation, advertising, fraud detection, and financial markets.",
        "text": "in this course we are going to look at certain aspects of how to make sense of human data because data is not always straight so data is not always straight sometimes data is cute and then you know that to make sense of the particular data you know that if you have a question can anybody give an example like an essay data analysis in the real world? what sort of data analysis is big companies? what sort of analysis is it is in the idea? what you face in the real world? just just be some time in terms of the income of citizens so who will be interested in it? the government will be brought here so the U.J. is telling them income of citizens so based on that government will bring its policies and then they will take use and in this particular income line there are many people they need some support so that is good anyone answer from online? so any can anybody online experience the data analysis in real life? yes I think it is everyone had experience from data science is a previous semester because we had that acquisition of management cars and for myself I had some real work experience in text analysis okay you have experience in what field? a natural language process oh a natural language so can you just one or two lines? can you explain to the class what exactly what sort of data you analyzed and then what purpose you analyzed? in my question yeah you need not tell the details but at a high level you can just explain you said natural language was singed right? what sort of data you were collecting? I for natural language processing actually in this task I worked with with structure of web applications and I built some board metrics that convert text to array of list of numbers and develop neural networks for the analysis okay you are converting text to some arrays and then develop neural networks so what is the purpose of the neural network? like yes I appreciate you are going into the little bit detail of that okay you are using the text ultimately for what purpose? your neural network is doing some classification? yes it was classification was boundary specifications it is what I can talk about that we have for example two structure of elements of web application of value applications and neural networks should define its similar or not? okay it was actually a task of boundary classification okay you are doing the binary classification thank you so much so the result is giving this input so it was dealing data in the form of text usually it is a data in the form of income you know so income of residents of New York state so accordingly the state government can plan when the reactivity is open and some needs you know according so there is some text classification so probably one of the things of text classification is their 8th speech so especially these social media accounts you know so they they try to analyze what sort of you know posts you are doing and then immediately whether it falls into the category of killed or it's okay and then you know there is some objectionable thing so accordingly they try to censor it so you know so ultimately the thing is so they are trying to analyze the data every moment another thing like we can see is most of you might have experienced when you are doing some window shopping or online shopping you look for a particular product and then you don't you are not going to take it and you may take it later or you may just add it in the cart and leave it but at the same time you see that after three or four days when you are just browsing you get ads which are relevant to that particular product did you did you experience anything like that anytime so sometimes the ads are you know engineered as per our interest so this is some some sort of social engineering you are doing so this is based on the data they are collecting from our own browsing activities so the idea is there's a huge amount of data and then analyzing the data helps to enlarge each individual's business so that is the main purpose of this data and then we are doing lot of you know modeling of this particular data now the thing is the data whatever we have it's not always smooth and straightforward as it looks so we need to organize it properly for example if you are looking the browsing activity in a particular geographical location of the world so their needs will be different like suppose in all countries now people may be always looking for sweaters but when you are looking in and of dessert climate kind of like tropical countries which are close to equator so they will not be looking like various types of you know jerking and then all those things so when you are trying to understand the patterns buying patterns so you should collect the data accordingly now so the data you should not look for the data in a wrong place so what we are trying to say is data sometimes is skew so that's why whenever we are trying to do some sort of data analysis we should try to pick up our analysis techniques in a right way so I am just setting the precedent for the course so whatever we are discussing so they will be handling these indicate problems in data analysis so with this linear regression both simple and multiple and then these methods logistic regression and then non parameter regression and so on so the idea is these particular data modifications they will help further in machine learning this classifications just like Russell said so he is using some sort of text analysis and then all those things so that will go as an input to neural networks the neural networks are doing some sort of binary classification so similarly you know what is the pre processing data processing needed so that it will help in various classification techniques so that is what we are going to see in the next 8 to 10 models so here is the introduction and then so this is the standard textbook for books John this I have already uploaded a PDF and the Canvas course page is referred to that so that is the book so no need to run with the online videos so that is all not so you can just and then yeah so these are like broadly the distribution of grading every week you will be given an assignment to work on there will be deadlines so that will become according the particular person after the whole period so there will be one final exam that will be in around the first week of May or maybe end of April and yeah so that can be online or it will be hit person that can be at the side and there will be two projects so midterm and midterm project so there will be a presentation it's broadly this the details of midterm and midterm project I will upload after couple of weeks so this is it and then yeah the dates are there yeah you just get a idea of what we are broadly what we will broadly copy in this particular course so any questions still now before we go to the module one okay so let us go to today's discussion I uploaded the slide and lecture notes so you can those are on to see the lecture notes and you know most of your joining up so slide sharing okay I hope you are able to see my PDF whatever I am sharing okay you did right yeah you're able to see the video your name please I wish okay I should be the one yeah okay thank you so yeah today's lecture next half-leave we will be discussing something's left here so you just started with a very nice example that by the way the status gets up needed so you said very nice example that people collect income of the population so that they can plan the values that are activities accordingly how do you think you should copy it or any other similar example would you like to think or I wish by people collect standard those statistics like any other example anybody online also with respect to the social science think of you know demographics gender there are so many other things Professor can I go yeah yeah please so statistics we can use statistics for climate analysis so for gathering gathering the wind wind wind blow percentage and we can predict I mean there is a cyclone or something okay okay let's do this climate modeling so that's good yeah specifically that we say especially related to the society so we can think of something like this like people sometimes say that okay if you want to earn this particular income you know so what is the degree needed so how much education you have they try to map the income okay and sometimes people see that governments they are more what are the concerns for the government yes I wish one is to definitely provide them for activities to be any other any other thing which is which concerns the law income income anything else government is worried about the law enforcement yeah and then so crime rate of the control of the crime rate so government collects this particular data you know like a big cities you know like a very high levels of crime rate and then they try to correlate that particular dependent variable I mean like the crime rate on some observable maybe very okay why this is happening maybe because of lack of resources development or maybe because of poor education so like that so statistics are you know invent even in protocols society and then so there are obviously there are like various factors especially in human and in the accident so as the sites address so there are often multiple you know variables that are influencing the outcome of a particular way they are dependent variable and then there are observable variables so based on the observations we got from various variables a particular factor is influenced so we will be coming to that so often these things are quite complex it's not that that's straightforward correlation is there so how related to this and then we we discussed some of these things like online community moderation like a person is doing the AIDS page or some vulgar things or somebody is trying to influence the decisions like a forward what is the name like they try to push some particular agendas so it's broadly socially generic but especially politicians and government especially before the elections so these friends are quite calm so online community they try to pedal some particular narratives so that's what so I'm not taking sides of any politics but I'm just telling these things to happen okay and then the financial markets how to predict the share price and then blah blah so there is something called a supervised learning and a supervised learning and there is a reinforcement like"

projects so midterm and midterm project so there will be a presentation it's broadly this the details of midterm and midterm project I will upload after couple of weeks so this is it and then yeah the dates are there yeah you just get a idea of what we are broadly what we will broadly copy in this particular course so any questions still now before we go to the module one okay so let us go to today's discussion I uploaded the slide and lecture notes so you can those are on to see the lecture notes and you know most of your joining up so slide sharing okay I hope you are able to see my PDF whatever I am sharing okay you did right yeah you're able to see the video your name please I wish okay I should be the one yeah okay thank you so yeah today's lecture next half-leave we will be discussing something's left here so you just started with a very nice example that by the way the status gets up needed so you said very nice example that people collect income of the population so that they can plan the values that are activities accordingly how do you think you should copy it or any other similar example would you like to think or I wish by people collect standard those statistics like any other example anybody online also with respect to the social science think of you know demographics gender there are so many other things Professor can I go yeah yeah please so statistics we can use statistics for climate analysis so for gathering gathering the wind wind wind blow percentage and we can predict I mean there is a cyclone or something okay okay let's do this climate modeling so that's good yeah specifically that we say especially related to the society so we can think of something like this like people sometimes say that okay if you want to earn this particular income you know so what is the degree needed so how much education you have they try to map the income okay and sometimes people see that governments they are more what are the concerns for the government yes I wish one is to definitely provide them for activities to be any other any other thing which is which concerns the law income income anything else government is worried about the law enforcement yeah and then so crime rate of the control of the crime rate so government collects this particular data you know like a big cities you know like a very high levels of crime rate and then they try to correlate that particular dependent variable I mean like the crime rate on some observable maybe very okay why this is happening maybe because of lack of resources development or maybe because of poor education so like that so statistics are you know invent even in protocols society and then so there are obviously there are like various factors especially in human and in the accident so as the sites address so there are often multiple you know variables that are influencing the outcome of a particular way they are dependent variable and then there are observable variables so based on the observations we got from various variables a particular factor is influenced so we will be coming to that so often these things are quite complex it's not that that's straightforward correlation is there so how related to this and then we we discussed some of these things like online community moderation like a person is doing the AIDS page or some vulgar things or somebody is trying to influence the decisions like a forward what is the name like they try to push some particular agendas so it's broadly socially generic but especially politicians and government especially before the elections so these friends are quite calm so online community they try to pedal some particular narratives so that's what so I'm not taking sides of any politics but I'm just telling these

I for natural language processing actually in this task I worked with with structure of web applications and I built some board metrics that convert text to array of list of numbers and develop neural networks for the analysis okay you are converting text to some arrays and then develop neural networks so what is the purpose of the neural network? like yes I appreciate you are going into the little bit detail of that okay you are using the text ultimately for what purpose? your neural network is doing some classification? yes it was classification was boundary specifications it is what I can talk about that we have for example two structure of elements of web application of value applications and neural networks should define its similar or not? okay it was actually a task of boundary classification okay you are doing the binary classification thank you so much so the result is giving this input so it was dealing data in the form of text usually it is a data in the form of income you know so income of residents of New York state so accordingly the state government can plan when the reactivity is open and some needs you know according so there is some text classification so probably one of the things of text classification is their 8th speech so especially these social media accounts you know so they they try to analyze what sort of you know posts you are doing and then immediately whether it falls into the category of killed or it's okay and then you know there is some objectionable thing so accordingly they try to censor it so you know so ultimately the thing is so they are trying to analyze the data every moment another thing like we can see is most of you might have experienced when you are doing some window shopping or online shopping you look for a particular product and then you don't you are not going to take it and you may take it later or you may just add it in the cart and leave it but at the same time you see that after three or four days when you are just browsing you get ads which are relevant to that particular product did you did you experience anything like that anytime so sometimes the ads are you know engineered as per our interest so this is some some sort of social engineering you are doing so this is based on the data they are collecting from our own browsing activities so the idea is there's a huge amount of data and then analyzing the data helps to enlarge each individual's business so that is the main purpose of this data and then we are doing lot of you know modeling of this particular data now the thing is the data whatever we have it's not always smooth and straightforward as it looks so we need to organize it properly for example if you are looking the browsing activity in a particular geographical location of the world so their needs will be different like suppose in all countries now people may be always looking for sweaters but when you are looking in and of dessert climate kind of like tropical countries which are close to equator so they will not be looking like various types of you know jerking and then all those things so when you are trying to understand the patterns buying patterns so you should collect the data accordingly now so the data you should not look for the data in a wrong place so what we are trying to say is data sometimes is skew so that's why whenever we are trying to do some sort of data analysis we should try to pick up our analysis techniques in a right way so I am just setting the precedent for the course so whatever we are discussing so they will be handling these indicate problems in data analysis so with this linear regression both simple and multiple and then these methods logistic regression and then non parameter regression and so on so the idea is these particular data modifications they will help further in machine learning this classifications just like Russell said so he is using some sort of text analysis and then all those things so that will go as an input to neural networks the neural networks are doing some sort of binary classification so similarly you know what is the pre processing data processing needed so that it will help in various classification techniques so that is what we are going to see in the next 8 to 10 models so here is the introduction and then so this is the standard textbook for books John

immediately whether it falls into the category of killed or it's okay and then you know there is some objectionable thing so accordingly they try to censor it so you know so ultimately the thing is so they are trying to analyze the data every moment another thing like we can see is most of you might have experienced when you are doing some window shopping or online shopping you look for a particular product and then you don't you are not going to take it and you may take it later or you may just add it in the cart and leave it but at the same time you see that after three or four days when you are just browsing you get ads which are relevant to that particular product did you did you experience anything like that anytime so sometimes the ads are you know engineered as per our interest so this is some some sort of social engineering you are doing so this is based on the data they are collecting from our own browsing activities so the idea is there's a huge amount of data and then analyzing the data helps to enlarge each individual's business so that is the main purpose of this data and then we are doing lot of you know modeling of this particular data now the thing is the data whatever we have it's not always smooth and straightforward as it looks so we need to organize it properly for example if you are looking the browsing activity in a particular geographical location of the world so their needs will be different like suppose in all countries now people may be always looking for sweaters but when you are looking in and of dessert climate kind of like tropical countries which are close to equator so they will not be looking like various types of you know jerking and then all those things so when you are trying to understand the patterns buying patterns so you should collect the data accordingly now so the data you should not look for the data in a wrong place so what we are trying to say is data sometimes is skew so that's why whenever we are trying to do some sort of data analysis we should try to pick up our analysis techniques in a right way so I am just setting the precedent for the course so whatever we are discussing so they will be handling these indicate problems in data analysis so with this linear regression both simple and multiple and then these methods logistic regression and then non parameter regression and so on so the idea is these particular data modifications they will help further in machine learning this classifications just like Russell said so he is using some sort of text analysis and then all those things so that will go as an input to neural networks the neural networks are doing some sort of binary classification so similarly you know what is the pre processing data processing needed so that it will help in various classification techniques so that is what we are going to see in the next 8 to 10 models so here is the introduction and then so this is the standard textbook for books John this I have already uploaded a PDF and the Canvas course page is referred to that so that is the book so no need to run with the online videos so that is all not so you can just and then yeah so these are like broadly the distribution of grading every week you will be given an assignment to work on there will be deadlines so that will become according the particular person after the whole period so there will be one final exam that will be in around the first week of May or maybe end of April and yeah so that can be online or it will be hit person that can be at the side and there will be two projects so midterm and midterm project so there will be a presentation it's broadly this the details of midterm and midterm project I will upload after couple of weeks so this is it and then yeah the dates are there yeah you just get a idea of what we are broadly what we will broadly copy in this particular course so any questions still now before we go to the module one okay so let us go to today's discussion I uploaded the slide and lecture notes so you can those are on to see the lecture notes and you know most of your joining up so slide sharing okay I hope you are able to see my PDF whatever I am sharing okay you did right yeah you're able to see the video your name please I wish okay I should be the one yeah okay thank you so yeah today's lecture next half-leave we will be discussing something's left here so you just started with a very nice example that by the way the status gets up needed so you said very nice example that people collect income of the population so that they can plan the values that are activities accordingly how do you think you should copy it or any other similar example would you like to think or I wish by people collect standard those statistics like any other example anybody online also with respect to the social science think of you know demographics gender there are so many other things Professor can I go yeah yeah please so statistics we can use statistics for climate analysis so for gathering gathering the wind wind wind blow percentage and we can predict I mean there is a cyclone or something okay okay let's do this climate modeling so that's good yeah specifically that we say especially related to the society so we can think of something like this like people sometimes say that okay if you want to earn this particular income you know so what is the degree needed so how much education you have they try to map the income okay and sometimes people see that governments they are more what are the concerns for the government yes I wish one is to definitely provide them for activities to be any other any other thing which is which concerns the law income income anything else government is worried about the law enforcement yeah and then so crime rate of the control of the crime rate so government collects this particular data you know like a big cities you know like a very high levels of crime rate and then they try to correlate that particular dependent variable I mean like the crime rate on some observable maybe very okay why this is happening maybe because of lack of resources development or maybe because of poor education so like that so statistics are you know invent even in protocols society and then so there are obviously there are like various factors especially in human and in the accident so as the sites address so there are often multiple you know variables that are influencing the outcome of a particular way they are dependent variable and then there are observable variables so based on the observations we got from various variables a particular factor is influenced so we will be coming to that so often these things are quite complex it's not that that's straightforward correlation is there so how related to this and then we we discussed some of these things like online community moderation like a person is doing the AIDS page or some vulgar things or somebody is trying to influence the decisions like a forward what is the name like they try to push some particular agendas so it's broadly socially generic but especially politicians and government especially before the elections so these friends are quite calm so online community they try to pedal some particular narratives so that's what so I'm not taking sides of any politics but I'm just telling these things to happen okay and then the financial markets how to predict the share price and then blah blah so there is something called a supervised learning and a supervised learning and there is a

I for natural language processing actually in this task I worked with with structure of web applications and I built some board metrics that convert text to array of list of numbers and develop neural

bit detail of that okay you are using the text ultimately for what purpose? your neural network is doing some classification? yes it was classification was boundary specifications it is what I can talk about that we have for example two structure of elements of web application of value applications and neural networks should define its similar or not? okay it was actually a task of boundary

        "question": "How does statistical modeling contrast between social science and robotics?",
        "answer": "In social science, models must handle uncertainty and unpredictable human behavior. In robotics, models often follow deterministic rules, such as visual perception and movement control, which are easier to model mathematically.",
        "text": "in this course we are going to look at certain aspects of how to make sense of human data because data is not always straight so data is not always straight sometimes data is cute and then you know that to make sense of the particular data you know that if you have a question can anybody give an example like an essay data analysis in the real world? what sort of data analysis is big companies? what sort of analysis is it is in the idea? what you face in the real world? just just be some time in terms of the income of citizens so who will be interested in it? the government will be brought here so the U.J. is telling them income of citizens so based on that government will bring its policies and then they will take use and in this particular income line there are many people they need some support so that is good anyone answer from online? so any can anybody online experience the data analysis in real life? yes I think it is everyone had experience from data science is a previous semester because we had that acquisition of management cars and for myself I had some real work experience in text analysis okay you have experience in what field? a natural language process oh a natural language so can you just one or two lines? can you explain to the class what exactly what sort of data you analyzed and then what purpose you analyzed? in my question yeah you need not tell the details but at a high level you can just explain you said natural language was singed right? what sort of data you were collecting? I for natural language processing actually in this task I worked with with structure of web applications and I built some board metrics that convert text to array of list of numbers and develop neural networks for the analysis okay you are converting text to some arrays and then develop neural networks so what is the purpose of the neural network? like yes I appreciate you are going into the little bit detail of that okay you are using the text ultimately for what purpose? your neural network is doing some classification? yes it was classification was boundary specifications it is what I can talk about that we have for example two structure of elements of web application of value applications and neural networks should define its similar or not? okay it was actually a task of boundary classification okay you are doing the binary classification thank you so much so the result is giving this input so it was dealing data in the form of text usually it is a data in the form of income you know so income of residents of New York state so accordingly the state government can plan when the reactivity is open and some needs you know according so there is some text classification so probably one of the things of text classification is their 8th speech so especially these social media accounts you know so they they try to analyze what sort of you know posts you are doing and then immediately whether it falls into the category of killed or it's okay and then you know there is some objectionable thing so accordingly they try to censor it so you know so ultimately the thing is so they are trying to analyze the data every moment another thing like we can see is most of you might have experienced when you are doing some window shopping or online shopping you look for a particular product and then you don't you are not going to take it and you may take it later or you may just add it in the cart and leave it but at the same time you see that after three or four days when you are just browsing you get ads which are relevant to that particular product did you did you experience anything like that anytime so sometimes the ads are you know engineered as per our interest so this is some some sort of social engineering you are doing so this is based on the data they are collecting from our own browsing activities so the idea is there's a huge amount of data and then analyzing the data helps to enlarge each individual's business so that is the main purpose of this data and then we are doing lot of you know modeling of this particular data now the thing is the data whatever we have it's not always smooth and straightforward as it looks so we need to organize it properly for example if you are looking the browsing activity in a particular geographical location of the world so their needs will be different like suppose in all countries now people may be always looking for sweaters but when you are looking in and of dessert climate kind of like tropical countries which are close to equator so they will not be looking like various types of you know jerking and then all those things so when you are trying to understand the patterns buying patterns so you should collect the data accordingly now so the data you should not look for the data in a wrong place so what we are trying to say is data sometimes is skew so that's why whenever we are trying to do some sort of data analysis we should try to pick up our analysis techniques in a right way so I am just setting the precedent for the course so whatever we are discussing so they will be handling these indicate problems in data analysis so with this linear regression both simple and multiple and then these methods logistic regression and then non parameter regression and so on so the idea is these particular data modifications they will help further in machine learning this classifications just like Russell said so he is using some sort of text analysis and then all those things so that will go as an input to neural networks the neural networks are doing some sort of binary classification so similarly you know what is the pre processing data processing needed so that it will help in various classification techniques so that is what we are going to see in the next 8 to 10 models so here is the introduction and then so this is the standard textbook for books John this I have already uploaded a PDF and the Canvas course page is referred to that so that is the book so no need to run with the online videos so that is all not so you can just and then yeah so these are like broadly the distribution of grading every week you will be given an assignment to work on there will be deadlines so that will become according the particular person after the whole period so there will be one final exam that will be in around the first week of May or maybe end of April and yeah so that can be online or it will be hit person that can be at the side and there will be two projects so midterm and midterm project so there will be a presentation it's broadly this the details of midterm and midterm project I will upload after couple of weeks so this is it and then yeah the dates are there yeah you just get a idea of what we are broadly what we will broadly copy in this particular course so any questions still now before we go to the module one okay so let us go to today's discussion I uploaded the slide and lecture notes so you can those are on to see the lecture notes and you know most of your joining up so slide sharing okay I hope you are able to see my PDF whatever I am sharing okay you did right yeah you're able to see the video your name please I wish okay I should be the one yeah okay thank you so yeah today's lecture next half-leave we will be discussing something's left here so you just started with a very nice example that by the way the status gets up needed so you said very nice example that people collect income of the population so that they can plan the values that are activities accordingly how do you think you should copy it or any other similar example would you like to think or I wish by people collect standard those statistics like any other example anybody online also with respect to the social science think of you know demographics gender there are so many other things Professor can I go yeah yeah please so statistics we can use statistics for climate analysis so for gathering gathering the wind wind wind blow percentage and we can predict I mean there is a cyclone or something okay okay let's do this climate modeling so that's good yeah specifically that we say especially related to the society so we can think of something like this like people sometimes say that okay if you want to earn this particular income you know so what is the degree needed so how much education you have they try to map the income okay and sometimes people see that governments they are more what are the concerns for the government yes I wish one is to definitely provide them for activities to be any other any other thing which is which concerns the law income income anything else government is worried about the law enforcement yeah and then so crime rate of the control of the crime rate so government collects this particular data you know like a big cities you know like a very high levels of crime rate and then they try to correlate that particular dependent variable I mean like the crime rate on some observable maybe very okay why this is happening maybe because of lack of resources development or maybe because of poor education so like that so statistics are you know invent even in protocols society and then so there are obviously there are like various factors especially in human and in the accident so as the sites address so there are often multiple you know variables that are influencing the outcome of a particular way they are dependent variable and then there are observable variables so based on the observations we got from various variables a particular factor is influenced so we will be coming to that so often these things are quite complex it's not that that's straightforward correlation is there so how related to this and then we we discussed some of these things like online community moderation like a person is doing the AIDS page or some vulgar things or somebody is trying to influence the decisions like a forward what is the name like they try to push some particular agendas so it's broadly socially generic but especially politicians and government especially before the elections so these friends are quite calm so online community they try to pedal some particular narratives so that's what so I'm not taking sides of any politics but I'm just telling these

projects so midterm and midterm project so there will be a presentation it's broadly this the details of midterm and midterm project I will upload after couple of weeks so this is it and then yeah the dates are there yeah you just get a idea of what we are broadly what we will broadly copy in this particular course so any questions still now before we go to the module one okay so let us go to today's discussion I uploaded the slide and lecture notes so you can those are on to see the lecture notes and you know most of your joining up so slide sharing okay I hope you are able to see my PDF whatever I am sharing okay you did right yeah you're able to see the video your name please I wish okay I should be the one yeah okay thank you so yeah today's lecture next half-leave we will be discussing something's left here so you just started with a very nice example that by the way the status gets up needed so you said very nice example that people collect income of the population so that they can plan the values that are activities accordingly how do you think you should copy it or any other similar example would you like to think or I wish by people collect standard those statistics like any other example anybody online also with respect to the social science think of you know demographics gender there are so many other things Professor can I go yeah yeah please so statistics we can use statistics for climate analysis so for gathering gathering the wind wind wind blow percentage and we can predict I mean there is a cyclone or something okay okay let's do this climate modeling so that's good yeah specifically that we say especially related to the society so we can think of something like this like people sometimes say that okay if you want to earn this particular income you know so what is the degree needed so how much education you have they try to map the income okay and sometimes people see that governments they are more what are the concerns for the government yes I wish one is to definitely provide them for activities to be any other any other thing which is which concerns the law income income anything else government is worried about the law enforcement yeah and then so crime rate of the control of the crime rate so government collects this particular data you know like a big cities you know like a very high levels of crime rate and then they try to correlate that particular dependent variable I mean like the crime rate on some observable maybe very okay why this is happening maybe because of lack of resources development or maybe because of poor education so like that so statistics are you know invent even in protocols society and then so there are obviously there are like various factors especially in human and in the accident so as the sites address so there are often multiple you know variables that are influencing the outcome of a particular way they are dependent variable and then there are observable variables so based on the observations we got from various variables a particular factor is influenced so we will be coming to that so often these things are quite complex it's not that that's straightforward correlation is there so how related to this and then we we discussed some of these things like online community moderation like a person is doing the AIDS page or some vulgar things or somebody is trying to influence the decisions like a forward what is the name like they try to push some particular agendas so it's broadly socially generic but especially politicians and government especially before the elections so these friends are quite calm so online community they try to pedal some particular narratives so that's what so I'm not taking sides of any politics but I'm just telling these

I for natural language processing actually in this task I worked with with structure of web applications and I built some board metrics that convert text to array of list of numbers and develop neural networks for the analysis okay you are converting text to some arrays and then develop neural networks so what is the purpose of the neural network? like yes I appreciate you are going into the little bit detail of that okay you are using the text ultimately for what purpose? your neural network is doing some classification? yes it was classification was boundary specifications it is what I can talk about that we have for example two structure of elements of web application of value applications and neural networks should define its similar or not? okay it was actually a task of boundary classification okay you are doing the binary classification thank you so much so the result is giving this input so it was dealing data in the form of text usually it is a data in the form of income you know so income of residents of New York state so accordingly the state government can plan when the reactivity is open and some needs you know according so there is some text classification so probably one of the things of text classification is their 8th speech so especially these social media accounts you know so they they try to analyze what sort of you know posts you are doing and then immediately whether it falls into the category of killed or it's okay and then you know there is some objectionable thing so accordingly they try to censor it so you know so ultimately the thing is so they are trying to analyze the data every moment another thing like we can see is most of you might have experienced when you are doing some window shopping or online shopping you look for a particular product and then you don't you are not going to take it and you may take it later or you may just add it in the cart and leave it but at the same time you see that after three or four days when you are just browsing you get ads which are relevant to that particular product did you did you experience anything like that anytime so sometimes the ads are you know engineered as per our interest so this is some some sort of social engineering you are doing so this is based on the data they are collecting from our own browsing activities so the idea is there's a huge amount of data and then analyzing the data helps to enlarge each individual's business so that is the main purpose of this data and then we are doing lot of you know modeling of this particular data now the thing is the data whatever we have it's not always smooth and straightforward as it looks so we need to organize it properly for example if you are looking the browsing activity in a particular geographical location of the world so their needs will be different like suppose in all countries now people may be always looking for sweaters but when you are looking in and of dessert climate kind of like tropical countries which are close to equator so they will not be looking like various types of you know jerking and then all those things so when you are trying to understand the patterns buying patterns so you should collect the data accordingly now so the data you should not look for the data in a wrong place so what we are trying to say is data sometimes is skew so that's why whenever we are trying to do some sort of data analysis we should try to pick up our analysis techniques in a right way so I am just setting the precedent for the course so whatever we are discussing so they will be handling these indicate problems in data analysis so with this linear regression both simple and multiple and then these methods logistic regression and then non parameter regression and so on so the idea is these particular data modifications they will help further in machine learning this classifications just like Russell said so he is using some sort of text analysis and then all those things so that will go as an input to neural networks the neural networks are doing some sort of binary classification so similarly you know what is the pre processing data processing needed so that it will help in various classification techniques so that is what we are going to see in the next 8 to 10 models so here is the introduction and then so this is the standard textbook for books John

If the bin count is too low, the model exhibits high bias, meaning it oversimplifies data and fails to capture important variations. However, as we increase the number of bins, bias decreases, but variance increases.\nNow, let\u0092s clarify why bias reduces when the bin count increases. If you look at the two figures, one represents a dataset with a large bin size (fewer bins), and the other represents a dataset with a smaller bin size (more bins). When bin sizes are large (fewer bins), bias is high because data points are aggregated into broader categories, leading to less detailed insights. However, when bin sizes are small (more bins), variance increases because each bin has fewer elements, making the model more sensitive to random fluctuations.\nThe final takeaway is that choosing the right bin size is essential for achieving a balance between bias and variance. If we have too few bins, the model oversimplifies the data, losing crucial details. If we have too many bins, the model overfits, capturing too much variance and making predictions unstable. The goal is to find an optimal number of bins where data representation is accurate, meaningful, and useful for analysis.\n"

What is the epsilon here? The difference between the true value and the predictive value. Like error. Yeah exactly it's an error So you are trying to predict something okay but the actual value is something else okay so you want to minimize the error between what you are predicting and what is the actual value okay so that is called residue. Like I'm saying you know I want to predict the rent of a flat so it is the actual thing is $2000 so you say that positive residue should be minimized so it should maximum go to $2100 your prediction so negative residue is fine. You are saying negative residue means $100 I predict is that okay? No. So say it's like we have to reduce you know both positive residue and negative residue. Residue itself is bad so if you take a mean of this residue so it may be equal to zero but the thing is you know so there will be positive high positives and high negatives so it may result. So that's why just taking the mean of the residues is not a good idea okay so that's why we are going to this summation of squares and we are minimizing it. So just like taking the derivative so we come to this particular conclusion so beta and then alpha are this so this is a long mathematical derivation.

So this is the TSS. This is y i minus the mean. So this is the summation of all of the differences. Then there is RSS. We are thinking our model is linear but suppose you know the data is related in a parabolic fashion. So that is what now you see the difference between the two is the regression sum of squares. The TSS minus RSS. The correlation coefficient gives the reduction in the squared error due to linear regression. The ratio of regression sum of squares to TSS proportional reduction in squared error defines the square of correlation coefficient. To find the correlation coefficient R, we just take a square root of r square. So what is the significance of that? If there is a perfect positive linear relationship between y and x, then R equal to 1. In our figures, if you recollect, there are six plots. The first two is R is zero. Okay but we are trying to impose linear regression there . A perfect negative linear relationship corresponds to R equal to minus 1. Okay so you can see here R equal to minus 1. it's a perfect linear correlation but in a negative direction. There is no linear relationship between y and x, then you know both RSS and TSS are equal, so and then the regression sum of squares is zero. So this is what is there in panel B. Between these extremes, R gives the direction of linear relationship between the two variables. And R square can be interpreted as the proportion of total variation of y that is captured by its linear regression on x. So we see here R square is RegSS by TSS. So how much amount of variance is captured by the regression compared to this TSS. So figure 5.4 illustrates several levels of correlation as in 5.4 B R is equal to zero the correlation can be small even when there is strong non-linear relationship between x and y. So here it can be very nicely defined , y in terms of x square or x square mx square plus C so the model can be defined but that is a non-linear relationship.

Instead of dealing with individual equations for each predictor, we use matrices and vectors to represent the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.\n\nThe sum of squared errors (SSE) in matrix form is given as SSE = E?E = (Y ? XB)? (Y ? XB), where:\n\nY is the vector of observed values, containing all dependent variable values across n samples.\nX is the matrix of predictor variables, structured with n rows (samples) and k columns (predictors). The first column of X is typically set to ones to account for the intercept (A) in the model.\nB is the vector of regression coefficients, representing the impact of each predictor variable.\nTo find the best-fitting regression coefficients, we derive the normal equations, which solve for B by minimizing the SSE. This matrix-based approach simplifies computations and is particularly useful when dealing with multiple regressors. It also provides an elegant way to extend regression analysis to large datasets and complex models."

So what I'm trying to say is like the projection is linear here. Right. But here the projection is scattered. Okay. So let us see, you know, basically the idea is. I just want to reinforce the point. Okay. So you're trying to compute ultimately what. The sum of the square of errors and then minimize it. So that is the idea. So if you want to build a model.

So that is the idea which they are trying to drive in. The impact of co linearity on the stability of least squares regression plane. In a, the correlation between X1 and X2 is small. So that's why we can see that the points are of the projection. You know, it's all scattered. The regression plane therefore has a broad base of support.

So that is why they're saying that it is less stable. And then more planes are possible. In B, X1 and X2 are perfectly correlated. The least square plane is not uniquely defined. So there can be multiple planes passing through the line. So this is quite straight forward. In C, it is not perfect. Colinearity doesn't exist. But it's near to that.

The advantage of A or B. I think there are two minimum points in the B and in a there is only one. B how many minimum points are there? I think two. Why so. And what are they? So that are the corners. Well, it is not like there are two points definitely, but the thing is like along. You know those two points the line connecting along those two points. So all have that minimum value of RSS. Yeah, so basically the diagonal that is joining the base. So all the points existing on that have the minimum RSS.

So all have that minimum value of RSS. Yeah, so basically the diagonal that is joining the base. So all the points existing on that have the minimum RSS.

Like we saw X1 and X2 if they are linearly related. So they say that why don't you come up with a new variable instead of X1 and X2. Say consider X prime. And then define a new variable, which is having a proper relationship like this, you know, the standard deviation. And then X1 by standard deviation of X1, X2 by standard deviation of X2.

Those who are in Manhattan. Those who want to rent one bedroom unit, I will give them five dollars. So will that have any effect on them.? Our prediction if we add that as a variable? It will not have an effect. But if if the government says we are going to fund, you know, 50% of their rent or 25% of say realistically 10% of their rent. So immediately it will have effect. It will have an effect like if we bring that particular criteria into our model. So it will have an effect.

So they are saying a forward model. Let us start one by one. Okay. The rent depends on location. So that is the first thing. And then after that. The rent depends on the neighborhood. I mean location means. Yeah, it's a business center and then all those things. And then second thing is the crime rate. You know, so like that one of the variables we add. And then see that how much it is having the effect on the final. This is called the forward process. So variable selection is one of the methods of addressing the collinearity. A common but unusually misguided approach to collinearity is variable selection, where some automatic procedure is employed to reduce the regressors or the explainer variables in the model. So I was discussing the forward selection. We are considering the explanatory variables. Forward selection methods add explanatory variables to the model one at a time. At each step, the variable yields the largest increment in r square. Okay. So the delta of the r square, so whichever is the variable that is adding to giving the largest increment. So that we are going to add. So this is one of the method. So the process just stops for example when the increment is smaller than the person. Preset criteria. And the backward similarly there is a backward elimination like let us consider 1000 explanatory variables. Let us consider all the 1000 and then start eliminating one after another. So which is like less influential. You are going to build the model. So how much the model should be responsive. So there is no standard definition. They say heuristic means you know you observe and then you choose a delta. Thresholds are always heuristic. The forward is like you're adding one after one variable. When you're going to add a particular variable to your model on what basis? So first you will see the highest variable that is going to contribute. So to the R square. So that will be.

I mean location means. Yeah, it's a business center and then all those things. And then second thing is the crime rate. You know, so like that one of the variables we add. And then see that how much it is having the effect on the final. This is called the forward process. So variable selection is one of the methods of addressing the collinearity. A common but unusually misguided approach to collinearity is variable selection, where some automatic procedure is employed to reduce the regressors or the explainer variables in the model. So I was discussing the forward selection. We are considering the explanatory variables. Forward selection methods add explanatory variables to the model one at a time. At each step, the variable yields the largest increment in r square. Okay. So the delta of the r square, so whichever is the variable that is adding to giving the largest increment. So that we are going to add. So this is one of the method. So the process just stops for example when the increment is smaller than the person. Preset criteria. And the backward similarly there is a backward elimination like let us consider 1000 explanatory variables. Let us consider all the 1000 and then start eliminating one after another. So which is like less influential. You are going to build the model. So how much the model should be responsive. So there is no standard definition. They say heuristic means you know you observe and then you choose a delta. Thresholds are always heuristic. The forward is like you're adding one after one variable. When you're going to add a particular variable to your model on what basis? So first you will see the highest variable that is going to contribute. So to the R square. So that will be. After that the second. So that's what they are saying. Yeah, so definitely it will. It will have an influence on the models, you know, yeah, capability."

        "question": "Why is it important to handle collinearity in regression models?",
        "answer": "Addressing collinearity ensures that coefficient estimates are reliable and that the model generalizes well to new data.",
        "text": "So how are we going to handle this particular collinearity. Now we said that, okay, there can be some explanatory variables, which are linearly related. Like we saw X1 and X2 if they are linearly related. So they say that why don't you come up with a new variable instead of X1 and X2. Say consider X prime. And then define a new variable, which is having a proper relationship like this, you know, the standard deviation. And then X1 by standard deviation of X1, X2 by standard deviation of X2. So these are like various ways, you know. This is called as model re specification. And then there is another way that. Suppose a particular variable. Like I say that, okay, the rent of a one bedroom apartment in Manhattan is dependent on the government's policy. So the government's policies, like US government federal policies. Those who are in Manhattan. Those who want to rent one bedroom unit, I will give them five dollars. So will that have any effect on them.? Our prediction if we add that as a variable? It will not have an effect. But if if the government says we are going to fund, you know, 50% of their rent or 25% of say realistically 10% of their rent. So immediately it will have effect. It will have an effect like if we bring that particular criteria into our model. So it will have an effect. So the understanding is like, when we are building a model, each explanatory variable has some effect on the response variable in itself. So here we are trying to, you know, eliminate. So there is a forward. There's a backward. There are ways of considering these variables. How many variables to include in our model. 10, 100,1000 how many explanatory variables to include. So they are saying a forward model. Let us start one by one. Okay. The rent depends on location. So that is the first thing. And then after that. The rent depends on the neighborhood.

So, the purpose of these two is whenever the dataset is too huge or explanatory variables are too many, we will use ridge regression and if there are less explanatory variables, then we will use lasso regression. So, what is lasso regression? So this is a regularization technique used in feature selection. We are trying to get the B vector. There are some explanatory variables which are not useful. So we are trying to eliminate those explanatory variables. Like, you know, the government of US is giving some support, but it is not useful, you know, we're going to eliminate that. So just for an example. So idea is to find what are the most influential explanatory variables, which we have to retain in our model. So this is a regularization technique used in feature selection. Using a shrinkage method also referred to as penalized regression method. So you are adding a penalty term. Okay. Lasso is the short form of this: Least absolute shrinkage selection operator, which is used both for regularization and model selection. If a model uses L1 regularization technique, then it is called Lasso regression. So in this shrinkage technique, coefficients are determined in a linear model, above or shrunk towards the central point as the mean by introducing a penalization factor. The penalty term that denotes the amount of shrinkage that will be implemented in the equation. So, and when this is 0, so then you will get the the standard thing. The model from equation 1.2 and a larger value penalizes the optimization function. Therefore, lesser regression shrinks the coefficients and helps to reduce the model complexity. So, let us see what is the ridge regression. So, ridge regression you see here they are considering this beta square, sum of the squares. The penalty factor basically contains the sum of the squares. Similar to lasso regression, ridge regression puts a similar constraint on the coefficients by introducing a penalty factor. Okay. However, while lasso regression takes the magnitude of the coefficients, ridge regression takes the square. Lasso tends to do well if there are small number of significant parameters, significant parameters means those explanatory variables that have an impact on the response to give them. Okay, and the others are close to 0. So, ridge works well if there are many large parameters of about the same value. So, the baseline is we don't know the parameters unless we try in the model. Or in practice, we don't know the true parameter values. So, the previous two points are somewhat theoretical. Okay. So, there is something called as cross validation."

        "text": "Now, let\u0092s explore some practical applications of bootstrapping in machine learning and statistical modeling. Bootstrapping is useful when we need to estimate the standard error (SE) or obtain full distributions of complex or nonlinear summary statistics. This includes measures such as standard deviation, median, or the 79th percentile. Additionally, bootstrapping can be applied in custom statistical computations, such as functions written in Python, which may involve extensive data processing and business logic.\nFor example, we can use bootstrapping in:\nRegression models, where we resample the dataset multiple times and compute a vector B.\nHyperparameter tuning, where we run a subset selection algorithm using cross-validation, perform a final fit, and return the estimated  B vector.\nDeep learning, where we train a deep neural network multiple times on bootstrap samples and observe the variations in the learned weight vectors.\nPrediction models, where we build multiple models, each trained on different bootstrap samples, allowing for robust performance estimation.\nHowever, bootstrapping is not without its challenges. One major issue is the presence of outliers. For instance, imagine a scenario where 10 people have an average income of $100, but one individual earns $1000. This high-income individual is an outlier and can significantly distort the bootstrap-based estimates. The question arises: How do outliers impact bootstrapping methods? This is an open-ended issue that needs careful consideration. Another challenge is the dependency among data points. Unlike independent observations (e.g., measuring rental prices of one-bedroom apartments), bootstrapping creates resampled datasets where values are often repeated, leading to potential bias in estimation.

This transformation ensures that probabilities are mapped onto the entire real number range, making it easier to model with linear functions. The logistic regression equation is formulated as logit(\\pi) = A + B_1X_1 + B_2X_2 + \u0085 + \u0080, where AA is the intercept, B1,B2,\u0085B_1, B_2, \u0085 are coefficients, and X1,X2,\u0085X_1, X_2, \u0085 are input variables. To obtain the probability ?i, we take the inverse logit function, which is known as the sigmoid function. The sigmoid function transforms the linear model output into a probability, ensuring that values remain within the range (0,1)(0,1). Mathematically, this is represented as ?i=sigmoid(A+B1X1+\u0085 ). The sigmoid function plays a crucial role in logistic regression, enabling the model to make probabilistic predictions while maintaining a smooth and continuous decision boundary."

This measures how much variability there is in our estimated coefficient B. The formula here shows that it depends on the sum of xi^2?e^Bxi? divided by (1+eBxi?)^2, and then we take the inverse square root. Essentially, it tells us how precise our estimated coefficient is.Next, we have the Wald statistic, which is used to check the significance of our estimated coefficient B. It is calculated as z=B/SE(B), and it follows a standard normal distribution N(0,1) when n is large. If the z-value is large, we can conclude that the predictor variable associated with BBB is statistically significant. Moving on, we have the likelihood ratio tests. Here, G^2 is given by ?2lnLfull?, which helps measure how well the full model fits the data. Then, G0^2? compares the full model\u0092s log-likelihood with the log-likelihood of a simpler model that only includes a constant term. This is calculated as G0^2= 2(lnLfull? ? lnLconst?). If this value is large, it means our model provides a much better fit compared to a baseline model. Finally, we have pseudo R^2, which is used in logistic regression since we can\u0092t use the traditional R2R^2R2 from linear regression. It is defined as R2=1?lnLconst?lnLfull??. This gives us a measure of how well our model explains the variation in the data compared to a simple model with only a constant term. A higher R^2 means our model is doing a better job at fitting the data. So, overall, these statistics help us evaluate the fit of our model, check whether individual coefficients are significant, and compare models."

        "text": "In logistic regression, we often encounter two major issues\u0097multicollinearity and separability.

        "text": "Alright, in this slide, we are comparing Linear Regression and Logistic Regression side by side across various statistical aspects. This table summarizes key differences between the two models, focusing on their likelihood distribution, loss function, link function, prediction method, goodness of fit, model comparison metrics, and confidence intervals. First, let's start with the likelihood distribution. In linear regression, we assume the dependent variable yi? follows a normal distribution with a mean of BXi? and variance ??2?. This assumption allows us to model continuous outcomes. In contrast, logistic regression assumes a Bernoulli distribution, meaning each outcome follows a binary probability model, where pi? represents the probability that the outcome is 1. Next, the loss function differs between the two models. In linear regression, we minimize the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE), which is simply the squared differences between actual and predicted values. However, in logistic regression, we maximize the log-likelihood function instead. The log-likelihood is a function of the predicted probabilities ?i?, ensuring that the model captures the probability distribution of the binary outcome.Moving to the link function, linear regression uses an identity link function, meaning the relationship between input features and output is linear. However, logistic regression applies the logit function, which transforms the linear combination of inputs into a probability between 0 and 1. For prediction, linear regression estimates y^? directly as BX, while in logistic regression, we use the sigmoid function to transform BX into a probability ?\\pi?, which determines the classification output. Now, looking at goodness of fit, we see that both models use an adjusted R^2 metric, but in different ways. Linear regression calculates R^2 based on the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) and Total Sum of Squares (TSS), while logistic regression computes R^2 using the ratio of log-likelihoods from the full and constant-only models. When comparing models, linear regression uses the F-statistic, which assesses how much the regression sum of squares improves the fit compared to the residual sum of squares. On the other hand, logistic regression uses deviance (G^2_0?), which is derived from the log-likelihood difference between the full model and the null (constant-only) model. Lastly, for confidence intervals, both models rely on the standard normal distribution, where the coefficient estimate BBB is divided by its standard error SE(B) to follow a normal distribution."

However, logistic regression applies the logit function, which transforms the linear combination of inputs into a probability between 0 and 1. For prediction, linear regression estimates y^? directly as BX, while in logistic regression, we use the sigmoid function to transform BX into a probability ?\\pi?, which determines the classification output. Now, looking at goodness of fit, we see that both models use an adjusted R^2 metric, but in different ways. Linear regression calculates R^2 based on the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) and Total Sum of Squares (TSS), while logistic regression computes R^2 using the ratio of log-likelihoods from the full and constant-only models. When comparing models, linear regression uses the F-statistic, which assesses how much the regression sum of squares improves the fit compared to the residual sum of squares. On the other hand, logistic regression uses deviance (G^2_0?), which is derived from the log-likelihood difference between the full model and the null (constant-only) model. Lastly, for confidence intervals, both models rely on the standard normal distribution, where the coefficient estimate BBB is divided by its standard error SE(B) to follow a normal distribution."

        "answer": "While Linear Regression is suited for continuous outcomes with normally distributed errors, Logistic Regression is best for binary classification problems. Their statistical approaches differ, but both use maximum likelihood estimation in their respective ways.",
        "text": "Alright, in this slide, we are comparing Linear Regression and Logistic Regression side by side across various statistical aspects. This table summarizes key differences between the two models, focusing on their likelihood distribution, loss function, link function, prediction method, goodness of fit, model comparison metrics, and confidence intervals. First, let's start with the likelihood distribution. In linear regression, we assume the dependent variable yi? follows a normal distribution with a mean of BXi? and variance ??2?. This assumption allows us to model continuous outcomes. In contrast, logistic regression assumes a Bernoulli distribution, meaning each outcome follows a binary probability model, where pi? represents the probability that the outcome is 1. Next, the loss function differs between the two models. In linear regression, we minimize the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE), which is simply the squared differences between actual and predicted values. However, in logistic regression, we maximize the log-likelihood function instead. The log-likelihood is a function of the predicted probabilities ?i?, ensuring that the model captures the probability distribution of the binary outcome.Moving to the link function, linear regression uses an identity link function, meaning the relationship between input features and output is linear.

The logistic regression model is just one example of a broader category of GLMs.\n\nGLMs consist of three primary components:\nRandom Component \u0096 Represents the probability distribution of the response variable Y. For example, in binary logistic regression, Y follows a binomial distribution.\nSystematic Component \u0096 Refers to the explanatory variables (X?, X?, ...) combined in a linear predictor form. This explains why GLMs are called linear models\u0097because the regressors are linear.\nLink Function (g(?)) \u0096 Defines how the expected value of Y is related to the linear predictors. It links the random component (Y) with the systematic component (explanatory variables X?, X?, ...).\nFor example, let's compare two types of regression: Simple Linear Regression: Models how the mean (expected value) of a continuous response variable (Y) depends on explanatory variables (X). Random Component: Y follows a normal distribution.\nSystematic Component: X variables are explanatory variables with linear parameters ??, ??, ....\nLink Function: Identity function (g(?) = ?).\nBinary Logistic Regression: Models how a binary response variable (0/1 outcome) depends on explanatory variables (X).\nRandom Component: Y follows a binomial distribution.\nSystematic Component: X variables are linear predictors.\nLink Function: Logit function (logit(?) = log(P / 1 - P)).\nThus, in linear regression, the link function is an identity function, while in logistic regression, the link function is a logit function. The choice of a link function depends on the nature of the response variable and how we want to transform it to establish a meaningful relationship with explanatory variables.\nThis understanding helps in choosing the right type of GLM based on the data and ensures that the response variable is appropriately modeled with respect to the predictors. \n"
